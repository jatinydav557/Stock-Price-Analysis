# Project Brief: Stock Price Analysis of Tech Companies

This project involves analyzing the stock price movements of four major technology companies: Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, using historical stock data. The analysis is divided into several key areas:

## Key Areas of Analysis

### 1. Data Collection
Historical stock price data is gathered from CSV files, which includes various attributes such as date, closing price, and stock name.

### 2. Price Change Analysis
The project visualizes the changes in stock prices over time by plotting the closing prices of each company against their respective dates.

### 3. Moving Average Calculation
Moving averages are calculated over different time windows (10, 20, and 50 days) to smooth out price data and identify trends.

### 4. Daily Return Analysis
The daily return is computed to understand how much profit or loss is made on a daily basis, enabling the identification of volatility and trends.

### 5. Resampling Techniques
The closing prices are resampled on a monthly, quarterly, and yearly basis to analyze long-term trends.

### 6. Correlation Analysis
The project investigates the correlation between the closing prices of the different stocks to determine if they move together, providing insights into market behavior.

### 7. Visualizations
Various plots, including line plots, pair plots, and heatmaps, are generated to visualize relationships and trends in the stock data.

## Conclusion
Overall, the project aims to provide insights into the stock performance of major tech companies, helping investors and analysts understand market dynamics and make informed decisions.
